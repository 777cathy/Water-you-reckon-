# Water-you-reckon
“Water You Reckon?” is a crowd-sourced Android app that helps users find, review, and favourite local water sources. It aims to improve global water access by offering mapping, quality reviews, and bookmarking features.
The app provides users with the ability to view information (through site tiles) about local water sources, including the sources' names, addresses, and water quality readings provided by other users. In addition to this, users can favourite their common sites, filter sources by desired quality or distance, search for sources by name, use their system's navigation app to find a route to the site, and provide ratings and reports of their own for sources they use. The data, stored in a realtime database, allows users logged-in users to view a range of data for water sources around the world (as well as providing new users with the ability to register an account that they can access the app with).
